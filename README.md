# Updates on the upcoming project 
## Working with Git on the commandline is cool,
-I hsve been ale to update the changes made on my remote repo to my loca repo by using 
```
git pull
```
which is way simple
- In addition, I have managed to update my remote repo with chnages I have made locally by 
```
git push
```
